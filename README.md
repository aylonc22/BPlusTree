## Project Description: B+ Tree with Arena Allocator in Java

This project implements a B+ tree data structure in Java, enhanced with an arena allocator for efficient memory management. The B+ tree is a self-balancing tree known for its ability to handle large datasets and provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations while maintaining sorted order.

### Key Features
- **B+ Tree Implementation:** Implements operations such as insertion, deletion, and search. Internal nodes hold keys for indexing, and leaf nodes contain data or data pointers.
  
- **Arena Allocator:** Manages memory efficiently by allocating large blocks (arenas) upfront and handling smaller allocations within these blocks, reducing fragmentation and improving memory access times.

### Goals
- **Efficiency:** Aims for logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for data operations within the B+ tree.
  
- **Memory Management:** Focuses on optimizing memory usage and minimizing overhead associated with memory allocations and deallocations.

### Applications
- Suitable for domains requiring efficient data storage and retrieval, such as database indexing, file systems, and in-memory databases.

### Technologies
- **Java Programming Language:** Chosen for its robust memory management capabilities and suitability for implementing complex data structures.

### Project Scope
- Design and implementation of the B+ tree data structure and arena allocator integration for efficient memory handling.

### Future Enhancements
- Potential additions include concurrency support, disk-based storage optimizations, and customization for specific use cases.

### Acknowledgement
- Special thanks to [Michael Yarichuk](https://github.com/myarichuk) for inspiring and motivating this project.

### Conclusion
This project blends advanced data structure concepts with efficient memory management techniques, offering a scalable solution for managing and accessing sorted data in memory-intensive Java applications.
